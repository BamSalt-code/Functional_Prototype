Previous versions of the project are stored in their respective version number directory
database must be created before app should be run, with the respective function in main.py
when registering for an account, the email currently MUST be opened on the same machine hosting/accessing the website

PREVIOUS versions stored in named file

previous versions stored do not contain all virtual environment files, they are just copies relocated into the previous versions directory,
so errors may occur there that did not in production/testing. To run these files, they may need to be ported to a new IDE, although i have not tested this,
so they may run fine

In production use, turn debug on the app starter to False in order prevent possible vulnerabilities
